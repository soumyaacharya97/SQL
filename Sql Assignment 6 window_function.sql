select * from Student_Performance


Q1.  Create a ranking of students based on score (highest first).

select *, row_number () over (order by score desc) as Students_ranking from Student_Performance
or
select *, rank () over (order by score desc) as Students_ranking from Student_Performance
or
select name, score, rank () over (order by score desc) as Students_ranking from Student_Performance


 Q2. Show each student's score and the previous student’s score (based on score order).
 
 SELECT 
    name, 
    score, 
    LAG(score) OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS previous_student_score
FROM Student_Performance;
 
 
Q3. Convert all student names to uppercase and extract the month name from join_date

SELECT 
    UPPER(name) AS student_name_upper, 
    MONTHNAME(join_date) AS join_month 
FROM Student_Performance;
or
select *, upper(name) as STUDENT_NAME, monthname(join_date) as join_month from Student_Performance


Q4. Show each student's name and the next student’s attendance (ordered by attendance).

SELECT 
    name, 
    attendance, 
    LEAD(attendance) OVER (ORDER BY attendance ASC) AS next_student_attendance
FROM Student_Performance;


Q5.  Assign students into 4 performance groups using NTILE()

SELECT 
    name, 
    score, 
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS performance_group
FROM Student_Performance;


Q6.  For each course, assign a row number based on attendance (highest first)

SELECT 
    name, 
    course, 
    attendance, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY course ORDER BY attendance DESC) AS attendance_rank
FROM Student_Performance;


Q7. Calculate the number of days each student has been enrolled (from join_date to today).
(Assume current date = '2025-01-01')

SELECT 
    name, 
    join_date, 
    DATEDIFF('2025-01-01', join_date) AS days_enrolled 
FROM Student_Performance;


Q8. Format join_date as “Month Year” (e.g., “June 2023”)

SELECT 
    name, 
    DATE_FORMAT(join_date, '%M %Y') AS formatted_join_date 
FROM Student_Performance;


Q9. Replace the city ‘Mumbai’ with ‘MUM’ for display purposes.

SELECT 
    name, 
    REPLACE(city, 'Mumbai', 'MUM') AS city_display 
FROM Student_Performance;


Q10. : For each course, find the highest score using FIRST_VALUE().

SELECT 
    name, 
    course, 
    score, 
    FIRST_VALUE(score) OVER (PARTITION BY course ORDER BY score DESC) AS highest_score_in_course
FROM Student_Performance;
