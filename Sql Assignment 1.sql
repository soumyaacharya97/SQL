Q1. . Create a New Database and Table for Employees

create database company_db;
use company_db;

create table employees (
employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
first_name varchar(50),
last_name varchar(50),
department VARCHAR(50),
salary int,
hire_date DATE);


Q2. Insert Data into Employees Table

insert into employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, department, salary, hire_date)
values
(101, 'Amit', 'Sharma', 'HR', 50000, '2020-01-15'),
(102, 'Riya', 'Kapoor', 'Sales', 75000, '2019-03-22'),
(103, 'Raj', 'Mehta', 'IT', '90000', '2018-07-11'),
(104, 'Neha', 'Verma', 'IT', '85000', '2021-09-01'),
(105,  'Arjun', 'Singh', 'Finance', '60000', '2022-02-10');

select * from employees


Q3. Display All Employee Records Sorted by Salary (Lowest to Highest)

select * from employees order by salary asc;


Q4. Show Employees Sorted by Department (A–Z) and Salary (High → Low)

department (A-Z)n
select * from employees order by department asc;
salary (high -> low)
select * from employees order by salary desc;


Q5. List All Employees in the IT Department, Ordered by Hire Date (Newest First)

select * from employees where department = 'IT' order by hire_date desc;


Q6. Create and Populate a Sales Table

create table Sales (
sale_id int,
customer_name varchar(50),
amount int,
sale_date date);

insert into Sales (sale_id, customer_name, amount, sale_date)
values
(1, 'Aditi', 1500, '2024-08-01'),
(2, 'Rohan', 2200, '2024-08-03'),
(3, 'Aditi', 3500, '2024-09-05'),
(4, 'Meena', 2700, '2024-09-15'),
(5, 'Rohan', 4500, '2024-09-25');

select * from Sales


Q7. Display All Sales Records Sorted by Amount (Highest → Lowest)

select * from Sales order by amount desc;


Q8. Show All Sales Made by Customer “Aditi”

select * from Sales where customer_name = 'Aditi';


Q9. What is the Difference Between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?
PRIMARY KEY:
- Uniquely identifies each record in a table
- Cannot contain NULL values
- Each table can have only ONE primary key
- Automatically creates a unique index
- Example: employee_id in employees table

FOREIGN KEY:
- Creates a link between two tables
- References the primary key of another table
- Can contain NULL values (unless NOT NULL constraint is specified)
- A table can have multiple foreign keys
- Enforces referential integrity
- Example: If we had a 'projects' table with employee_id as foreign key,
  it would reference employees.employee_id
  
  Key Difference: 
Primary Key = Unique identifier within a table
Foreign Key = Reference to a Primary Key in another table (creates relationships)


Q10. What Are Constraints in SQL and Why Are They Used?

CONSTRAINTS in SQL are rules applied to columns to enforce data integrity and accuracy.

COMMON CONSTRAINTS:

1. PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each record, no duplicates, no NULLs

2. FOREIGN KEY: Ensures referential integrity between tables

3. NOT NULL: Column cannot have NULL values

4. UNIQUE: All values in column must be different

5. CHECK: Ensures values meet a specific condition
   Example: CHECK (salary > 0)

6. DEFAULT: Sets a default value if none is provided
   Example: DEFAULT 'Active'

7. AUTO_INCREMENT: Automatically generates unique numbers

WHY USE CONSTRAINTS?
- Data Integrity: Prevents invalid data from entering the database
- Data Accuracy: Ensures data follows business rules
- Consistency: Maintains relationships between tables
- Error Prevention: Catches mistakes at database level
- Documentation: Makes database structure self-documenting

Example with constraints:
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18),
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Active');
